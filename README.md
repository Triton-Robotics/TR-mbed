# MBED STUDIO Setup

## Basic Installation

- Click this link and install [Mbed STudio](https://os.mbed.com/studio/)

- Install Github Desktop [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

- Open Github Desktop and clone this repo to any location using this link: https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os.git

## Cloning Triton Robotics Github Repo

- Clone the [TR Github](https://github.com/Triton-Robotics/TR-mbed6) with Github Desktop and PUT IT IN THE MBED PROGRAMS FOLDER. It should look like this: "C:/Users/Mbed Programs/TR-mbed6" 

## Installing a Junction

You need to create a **JUNCTION** in the TR-mbed6 folder to point to the mbed-os library. A junction is basically a glorified shortcut, except it is not the same thing.

1. Install the [Link Shell Extension](https://download.cnet.com/Link-Shell-Extension-64-bit/3000-2248_4-75213087.html)

2. Right click on the **mbed-os** folder that you cloned at the very beginning (Usually in Docuements/Github)

3. Pick Link Source on the **mbed-os** folder

4. Go inside **TR-mbed6** and right click, select **Drop As Junction**

## OPTIONAL: Setting hotkeys for building/running

Hitting the play button over and over again hurts fingies. Why not set a hotkey for it? 

1) Press ctrl+alt+comma to open the shortcuts menu

2) Search for "Run on device" 

3) Set that hotkey to "ctrl+u" (LITERALLY TYPE THAT IN)

4) Search for "Build"

5) Set that hotkey to "ctrl+r" (LITERALLY TYPE THAT IN)

**Your fingers will thank you later.......**
